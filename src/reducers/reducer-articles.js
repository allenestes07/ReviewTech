        {paragraph: "I enjoy testing out products, and providing an honest review of my opinion of the product. The latest product in my review line up is the Ring Door Bell. I will start by stating that I have wanted this product for a little while, but couldn’t bring myself to spending $199.99 dollars for a door bell. However, this product was a hot item on black friday for $99.99. This was a little closer to the price that I was willing to spend for a digital door bell."},
        {paragraph: "The Ring Door Bell connects to your homes wifi network. It is also equipped with an HD (720p) camera which does \”Live View\”, and motion recordings. The recordings are sent real time to your smart phone, and can be viewed through the Ring app. Whenever someone pushes the Ring button it will notify your phone via the Ring app. This allows you to see the person at the door, and even speak with the person through the Ring speaker."},
        {paragraph: "There are two options for installation you can hardwire the door bell by using the wiring from the pervious doorbell, or use the internal battery. I decided to hardwire my Ring doorbell to avoid having to unmount, and charge the device. The installation took around ten minutes to mount, and wire. The application walks you through setting up the Ring doorbell which is a nice feature. I would rate the installation as being fairly simple to install."},
        {paragraph: "The video quality on this device is very good. The camera captures 180-degree angle, and records a nice HD video. It allows me to see when packages arrive at my residence. It also allows me to see solicitors without having to open the door, and speaking with them. The video also records in night vision as well. Overall I am pretty happy with this device. However, it does require a yearly subscription fee of $30 dollars to view the recorded videos. The videos that are captured are viewable up to six months. The recordings cannot be viewed if you decide to not sign up for the subscription . I personally would prefer to not have another monthly, or yearly subscription but it is fairly cheap."}

        {paragraph: "The holidays can be a high-pressure time of year causing pistons to fire on all cylinders. Many people put up decorations, and make baked goods. Instead of sending yourself into a freenzy, and holiday overload more people should take time to relax. I myself, survive the holidays by relaxing and taking a little time away from work. It is a perfect time to spend with family, and enjoy their company."},
        {paragraph: "This year my son is two, and I have never thought so deeply about how important the holidays really are. As a family we drove through a holiday park. This park is pretty spectacular there are lights all around. At the entrance there is a sign that tells you to turn off your lights as you drive through the park. My son loved it, and he had a lot to say as we drove through the park. As I recall when we drove past one set of lights we heard a little voice in back seat that said \"Buddy Raggets\" aka Bunny Rabbits. I remember my wife, and I laughing about this and it made a very rememberable moment. These are the moments, and memories that the holidays are meant for."},
        {paragraph: "As a family we have watched all three Santa Clause movies. After watching these movies I highly believe, that my son thinks that Tim Allen is the real Santa Clause. One day after watching these movies my son surprised me, and said Santa, Tree, Presents - It is always a proud moment when you see your two year old connecting the dots. These are times that as a parent you never want to end. As I analyze these remarkable moments it causes me to think about how much society has changed in such as short amount of time. I think as a society we spend to much time wrapped up in work, and technology such as social media, and cell phones causing us to miss out on these remarkable moments."},
        {paragraph: "While we are out I have noticed that everyone around are \"Prisoners\" to their \"cell\" phones. I myself find it hard to pull away from these distractions, because it is my profession and hobby to work with technology. However, since becoming a parent I have found that family is the most important thing you have and it is worth treasuring. The most magical time of the year is during the holidays, and it is a perfect time to put everything aside for the things that really matter. I hope everyone has a good holiday, and remember to put those distractions aside, and make the most of the holiday season with family, and friends."}
